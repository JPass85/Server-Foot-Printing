# Server Foot-Printing

## Description
Foot-printing a server is the process of gathering infomation about target server/network during the reconnaissance phase of a cybersecurity assessment or penetration test. It will involve the collection of data such as IP addresses, domain names, open ports, services, operating systems, and software versions that are running on the server. My goal is to create a detail map of target's structure, which can then be used to identify potentioal vulnerabilities for exploitation.
